# How to monitor the health of your elements

The recommended way to monitor the health of an element is to create a formula. Import [Element_Health_Formula.json](Element_Health_Formula.json) into your account and play around with it. It is designed to run every 15 minutes and make an API call against an instance and send an email if the request fails. 

A flowchart describing the formula can be found [here](Flowchart-HealthCheck.html).
